AM_StoreTab_ToolTip_0	The Kingdom is a confederacy of several states, populated primarily by humans. They were forced to band together to fight the endless stream of horrific units that have appeared following the Great Cataclysm.
AM_StoreTab_ToolTip_1	Bursts of Dark Magic, consequences of the Great Cataclysm, have turned many animals into terrible monsters, and raised the dead from their graves. Armies of transformed units, led by Demonologists, are ferocious opponents on the battlefield.
AM_StoreTab_ToolTip_100	The Infirmary is the place where fallen units go.
AM_StoreTab_ToolTip_2	The Ancient units are Beasts and other units who inhabited the archipelago before the Great Cataclysm. The majority of them didn't suffer from black magic, and they have remained the same in appearance and mind. The Ancients are neutral in the war against The Changed.
AM_StoreTab_ToolTip_3	Some forest Beasts were able to escape the Dark Magic. They are manageable and easy to tame.

AM_Unit_Class_Name_Defender	Defenders have an inexhaustible health which can withstand nearly any blow for a long time. Their heavy weapons allow Defenders to fight Warriors and Archers successfully.
AM_Unit_Class_Name_Gunner	Archers are not the most speedy units but they shot very precisely. Their special knowledge helps Archers defeat Healers and Sorcerers ignoring their resistance.
AM_Unit_Class_Name_Mage	Mages have mastered the art of battle magic. Their spells can easily get over the heaviest Defenders' armour and inflict enormous damage.
AM_Unit_Class_Name_Support	Healers believe healing and support to be their main vocations. Moreover, the Healer's unique weapon can overcome Mage's enchanted armour and pierce a plate of the Defender, which gives them an advantage in battle.
AM_Unit_Class_Name_Warrior	Warriors are able to move through the battlefield quickly and to break into the enemy's rear where they easily crush nimble Archers and Sorcerers by dealing them extra damage.

LF_Tip_0	Many units have Abilities that can be used in battle. Recently-used Abilities have to recharge before they become available again.
LF_Tip_1	Warriors can deal critical hits. The probability of landing a critical hit depends on the level of the unit's ‘Critical hit’ indicator.
LF_Tip_10	There are always people in the settlements who will be only too happy to send you on a quest, and reward you handsomely for its completion.
LF_Tip_11	You can send out gifts to your friends daily. The contents of these gifts are always something of a surprise.
LF_Tip_12	If one of your Licenses or Auras has run out, you can always renew it in the Royal Shop.
LF_Tip_13	When your Stamina is exhausted, you can always restore it by buying a Vial, Vessel or Elixir of Life.
LF_Tip_14	If you've run out of Gold, you can always stock up by buying one of the Chests from the Royal Shop.
LF_Tip_15	A Booster Pack of random units can be purchased at the Royal Shop. The more expensive the pack, the stronger units it may contain.
LF_Tip_16	By winning in battles against other players, you raise your rating, and can receive other valuable prizes.
LF_Tip_17	In order to go from one Legion to another, you need to notch up a whole string of victories in Knight battles.
LF_Tip_18	Friendly battles do not change your duel rating, but are ideal for training.
LF_Tip_19	If you've run out of Gold, you can always stock up by buying one of the Chests from the Royal Shop.
LF_Tip_2	In your squad's parameters, if some of the attributes are highlighted red or green, then that parameter has been reduced or increased.
LF_Tip_20	Invite your friends to explore a dungeon together to win an especially valuable reward.
LF_Tip_21	Whenever you receive a special reward, leave a message on your wall. By doing so, you share part of your prize with your friends.
LF_Tip_22	All of the units you recruit are kept in the Global Reserve. You can call them into battle from any of the settlements.
LF_Tip_23	The player's Leadership decides how many units of each class the player can bring under their command. The higher the player's Leadership, the mightier the army they can lead into battle.
LF_Tip_24	Each unit belongs to one of the following classes: Archer, Defender, Warrior, Healer or Sorcerer. Depending on which class it belongs to, a unit can be more effective in battle against units of other classes.
LF_Tip_25	Once you've sent your squad out on patrol, you can close the game and come back to it later.
LF_Tip_26	When you finish patrolling, you won't be able to send your squad out on patrol again for a certain period of time.
LF_Tip_27	By purchasing Licenses, you can increase the duration of the patrol as well as the reward you receive.
LF_Tip_28	Complete story-line quests to gain access to new settlements.
LF_Tip_29	Drop in on the game every day, and you shall be handsomely rewarded by the King.
LF_Tip_3	Next to the status effect icon is a number showing the number of rounds that its effects will last for. The colour of the arrow indicates negative (red) and positive (effects).
LF_Tip_30	When playing units of the same faction, the amount of gold and experience gained in combat is increased by 5%.
LF_Tip_4	Some attacks can cause burn or poison damage on the target. The injured squad will take health damage with every move, until they remedy the status effect.
LF_Tip_5	Purchase Scrolls in the settlements, or get them for completing tasks, then use them to gain the upper hand in battle.
LF_Tip_6	You won't find some of the units on sale - they are received as rewards for completing tasks. As a rule, these units possess unique abilities.
LF_Tip_7	Use units of the same race on the battlefield to increase your victory reward.
LF_Tip_8	You can take up to three Special units and one Legendary unit into battle.
LF_Tip_9	Moving between the settlements uses up a certain amount of Stamina, depending on how far apart the settlements are.

﻿quest_system_10735981_cntdesc_0	Conduct Patrol
quest_system_10735981_desc	Recently we’ve seen an increase in criminal activity. I need you to patrol this area a bit. If you come across a robber, then use your judgement. Give them what’s coming. When you’re gone, come bill me and I’ll reward you for your service.
quest_system_10735981_done	Well, how did it go? I see you managed to catch a couple of the local bandits. Well, at least things will be a little calmer for a while.

﻿quest_system_23347666_desc	It’s clear that you don’t know medicine, but hopefully you’re good with a sword. There are many Dark Griffins around here. A strong potion against magical wounds and poisons can be made with their feathers. A good half of our patients in the ward have burns or have been poisoned. This is war, after all. But I don’t have the time to run around catching griffins. They are dangerous creatures. But they won’t scare you. Right?
quest_system_23347666_done	Well, what do you know? It looks like you did well with the griffins. You’ll do fine for this job!

﻿quest_system_43990116_desc	The dark Mages have kidnapped Fatto the forester from our camp. They want to use him as a guide to get through our lands. We were combing the forest trying to find the kidnappers, but as soon as we managed to find some tracks heading North, we were captured by the baron's troops. It's not much use talking about it now. We've lost time, but I doubt the cultists have gone far – they'll be hiding in the Bear Forest. I'm hoping that you'll be able to find them and free Fatto. His knowledge of the dangerous inhabitants of these lands is essential for assuring safe passage for the Gray Wardens.
quest_system_43990116_done	Who's there? Oh my goodness. I had given up hope of ever encountering an actual human being again. I've spent the last few weeks in the company of those darned necromancers. I wouldn't wish being imprisoned by them on my worst enemy.
quest_system_43990116_name	Imprisoned by Dark Mages

quest_system_43990116_task	Talk to Fatto the Ranger



﻿quest_system_53145887_desc	I have arrived from the Mages' Academy on the Island of Ruttespiel on the orders of the Chair of Magical Studies at the University of Ruttespiel. I have been charged with tracking down and capturing several renegade mages. However, I am totally absorbed in studying books on magic at the royal library, so I am looking for someone to do that for me. You look like someone who's right for the job. But first, I need to test you, and your test will be a battle with extraordinary beasts. If you succeed, I will give you a generous reward.
quest_system_53145887_done	You're pretty good, after all. I thought you wouldn't make it, seeing how several "graduates" like you had tried, only to walk away with a broken nose. I am happy I can finally entrust my mission to someone and go back to studying the ancient folios. By the way, did you know the polar bears you just fought are very intelligent and true creatures really, who were tamed by our mages on a journey to the north of the Archipelago? These bears are very strong, tough and good-natured.

﻿quest_system_57959688_desc	Hmm... No, we’ll have to collect roots later. It’s time for you to go. Morania send word that she’s waiting for you in the Ancient Temple. And... Good luck to you!
quest_system_57959688_done	I thought death would arrive before you did. Alright, enough with the jokes. Let’s get to work. Yes, together! What, did you think that mages are all-powerful? We have access to the Power, but you have swords to cover us! What? You thought I was crazy. Well... around your Archmage I’d go crazy pretty quickly, but so far I’ve still got a straight head. Are you ready?
quest_system_57959688_name	Morania Is in the Temple Already!

quest_system_57959688_task	Find Morania the Witch in the Ancient Temple and speak with her.



﻿quest_system_67101472_desc	I must disappoint you. The records claim that the key was lost forever back in the days of the Jarl War. Completely forgot about that. Oh, bother. It appears as though our temple was in the possession of the only copy. What could we do? Is there any chance the smith who forged the original key might produce a duplicate? I heard he moved to the Miller's Crossroads.
quest_system_67101472_done	Abbot Lawrence? Didn’t I tell you I have no dealings with the order? I've got other things on my plate. 
quest_system_67101472_name	A New Key

﻿quest_system_83260012_desc	So, how about it? Our exorcists have noticed a Party of Condemned hiding on the outskirts of town. They were the ones preventing our ships from docking. It will take the Gray Wardens some time to set up. So we are counting on you for this one. You need to act immediately. Destroy them as quickly as possible. Otherwise, they might be able to cast another curse on the town.
quest_system_83260012_done	It looks like victory did not come easy. Right? Get used to it. Things will only get worse from here. We have reason to believe that a strong clan of disciples of dark magic has settled in the area. We are hoping that we will be able to take care of them before they have time to do something horrible.
quest_system_83260012_name	Cursed Warriors

﻿quest_system_85847362_desc	Acting under the authority of this unit commander, as entrusted to me by the Order, I hereby recall you and your team to active military service! It’s temporary, of course. And the pay is good. We need to cut down the numbers of Wild Horde scum that the pirates brought here. Otherwise, they may soon invade the continent, too. Are you ready for active duty?
quest_system_85847362_done	Not much, but it will keep them quiet for today. Thank you for your service to the King and the Order! At ease, dismissed, disperse!

quest_system_85847362_task	Destroy {counter_limit_0} Wild Horde squads. 



﻿quest_system_87193479_desc	Have you seen any paladins in our lands? They visit here quite often, looking for glory. It makes sense. No dragons? Well, squashing a couple of zombies won’t be too bad. And if a necromancer comes by, that’ll be quite handy. But this is all bad for my business. I’m an old-school necromancer, and I like it quiet. The deceased are the quietest creatures in the world and I think our titled friends, the paladins, should join their ranks. 
quest_system_87193479_done	Without these champions of glory we can have some peace and quiet. And it’s easier for me to go about my business, heh.

﻿quest_system_90862938_desc	My warning was just in time! Some kind of fanatics are storming the main entrance. Hurry up and help; destroy some of them!
quest_system_90862938_done	It seems we’re not the only ones privy to the contents of the Archives. And their timing was impeccable. They came just as you arrived with the key. Come on, let’s see what’s inside.

﻿quest_system_91933973_desc	Necromancers . . . my ancient enemies. They’ve become more cunning lately. They turn into Fiery Spiders and travel in packs to spy after me. But I’m onto their secret. Let’s get rid of some of them. Maybe one of those nasty Lazarus necromancers will be among them. Wouldn’t that be fun?
quest_system_91933973_done	These necromancers probably didn’t expect that anyone would hunt the fiery spiders, so now they’ll have to figure out a new kind of camouflage.
quest_system_91933973_name	Arachnomask

quest_system_91933973_task	Destroy {counter_limit_0} Fiery Spiders. 



﻿quest_system_100797383_desc	Psst! Come here, quietly . . . I’m here with orders from De Bursac. Do you see those lizards in black capes? They’re surely trying to do some witchcraft here. It’s an ancient heathen temple; any old nastiness can crawl out at the drop of a hat. And don't even ask about reinforcements. So it’s just the two of us, buddy. Ready? You dispatch the Demonologists and Gargoyle Shamans, and I’ll take care of the rest.
quest_system_100797383_done	Excellent. We did well enough; now they won’t have enough men for their ritual. They may have some new arrivals, for sure . . . But let’s deal with the problems as they come, OK?
quest_system_100797383_name	Interrupt the Ritual

﻿quest_system_108559336_desc	These Lazarus Cult Punishers are always roaming around our lands. I don’t know what they’re trying to find. I’m a military man. I have to deal with any clear and present danger to our security. But we can’t run after every crook that happens to linger around our walls. Especially when that means dealing with fanatics that happen to have some rudimentary knowledge of magic . . . My boys wouldn’t want to get entangled in this mess. But you appear to have experience enough in fighting any sort of enemy, so it shouldn’t be too much trouble for you to sort these annoying cultists out.
quest_system_108559336_done	I see that you were able to show the rule of law to the possessed fanatics of Lazarus. There’s no other way to deal with cultist lunatics. Don’t I know it.
quest_system_108559336_name	Divine Judgment

﻿quest_system_131185442_desc	Their main party must have gone deep into the swamps – to the Witch's Swamp, no less. It is perilous to venture any further. The swamps are the domain of the dark mages. We shall require the support of the battle mages from the Western Fort. Go there at once and speak to Magister Taron. We shall keep an eye on these cultists while you're gone. 
quest_system_131185442_done	So Captain Alistair finally realized he won't budge it all by himself? – I remember him saying he'd do it without any help from the mages.

﻿quest_system_133646233_desc	I have upgraded your key – it will be useful now for rendering some of the traps harmless, but it won't work on them all. So remember what I taught you. Maximus the Exorcist already awaits you at the Academy Tiltyard – this is where the ancient sanctuary is concealed. Very few know of its existence, so please keep this secret from everyone.

﻿quest_system_140777513_desc	The spiders have been coming out of the forest for the second day in a row. Their lair is there, but never before have they left it. At least not in these numbers. I have a hunch that something has incited them to flood in like this. When the troops come, they’ll have to fight their way through, and inevitably they’ll suffer some losses. I have some spider venom antidote, but not enough for such a large party. But for you and your warriors I’ll get a few flasks from my old supply. Destroy some Fiery Spiders and some Cave Spiders. It may scare the rest away.
quest_system_140777513_done	Well, now there are less of them around. Don’t know for how long, though. We must figure out what incited them to action.

﻿quest_system_150462002_desc	Our garrison is located at the cross-roads, and, as you can see, this creates an awful lot of problems. You may have heard that a gang of vagabonds recently plundered some wagon trains from the Knights’ Academy. They say some important manuscripts were involved, or something like that... Well anyway, the “upper crust” is seriously concerned with this problem and has even set a bounty on each vagabond from the gangs roaming our lands. I think this may interest you.
quest_system_150462002_done	That’s all; the work is done. I bet these bandits won’t have the guts to attack our wagon trains any more.

In particular, someone stole several gifts from the storehouse. Not that this is such a terrible offense, but just imagine how upset the kids will be unless they get their candy of firecracker. For these little ones the holiday would be spoilt... I have been able to roughly identify those involved in the theft. All you have to do is to bring back what has been stolen. Now, go!
quest_system_159652440_done	Have you managed to find the stolen gifts? What an excellent job! You are a true savior of the holiday!

But we found a way to control the spread of this scary pestilence. We can delay the outbreak by destroying the Plague Zombies. Truth be told, these Zombies are often surrounded by packs of many other enemies. But remember – you have to focus on finding the infected zombies. You are our last hope.
quest_system_162419775_done	I'm glad to hear that the numbers of zombies were greatly reduced. Who knows, maybe now the plague will fade away? But I don't think we can count on that. Hopefully, our medicine men will be able to come up with some kind of antidote.

And now the Scarlet Sash Pirates from the North are adding to our misery. They used to come only at night, but now they invade in broad daylight. But their gangs are not very large, so you’ll manage. Otherwise the Commander will have both our heads for failing to assure safe passage for the guardsmen along this road.
quest_system_181669723_done	What? Just a few weaklings? Well, maybe now there are just a few of them, but when it gets dark, there’s a whole bunch. So you did a good deed, both to help the troops and to protect us.

I’m in the middle of a terrible shortage of officers; therefore any able commander is worth his weight in gold to me. Your promotion order is already signed. You’ll have to prove yourself worthy of the promotion, though. Head immediately for the Karakol Port, find the Quartermaster and find out what’s delaying the reinforcements that were supposed to be here two days ago. I can invest in you significant authority, even... Well, actually, that can wait. Here’s my dispatch to the Quartermaster. Off you go!

﻿quest_system_681940150_desc	I was conducting an everyday investigation trying to figure out how exactly Locrim's magic staff was stolen. The fact that there were several miralis leaves found at the crime scene told me that the thieves came from the western forest. That's exactly where I found one of these strange creatures. I'm not sure whether they are animals or something completely different. They moved on their hind paws holding primitive spears in the front ones. I saw that they were using the stolen staff to conduct some kind of ritual. I do not believe that they have peaceful intentions. We need to return the staff to its owner as soon as possible before things turn for the worse.
quest_system_681940150_done	You have returned the staff. The mage will be ecstatic! How did you manage to get it back? I found out something about them.

No, the problem is that a protective curse has been placed on the tablet, rearranging the words. How odd that the Archmage didn’t see this. Or perhaps he did, but was unable to remove the spell? Heh-heh, mages aren’t what they used to be, before the War... I’ll help you, but I need your assistance, as well. This ritual requires the Magic of the Light. But how can I perform such a powerful spell in the midst of such chaotic and destructive energy? The bands of guardsmen and zombies that roam around here generate a negative background.

﻿quest_system_1085354394_desc	While you were looking for the key, we unearthed something that concerns this mysterious Lazarus. He's turned out to be one Lazarro Crucius, a former student of mine. As far as I remember, he got expelled from the academy because of his proclivity for the Sinister Arts; to be quite honest with you, I expected him to retire from the magical profession. Yet it appears that he has been vying for power all these years. There is no doubt that he aims for the ancient relics in the sanctuary. It is my fear that his cult seeks greater power by dint of these magic artifacts. We have a chance of beating them to the sanctuary, but this key lacks fine tuning and will prove useless against magic traps. Digory the Hermit has spent many years as a Professor at the Academy; he was the one who did the final work on the astral seals on the vault. I hope he might come up with a way of bypassing the magic traps. Go to his abode, and may the spirit of the great Rusith help us all.

﻿quest_system_1409259837_desc	I have been hearing reports from my men that there has been a suspiciously large number of people hiding their faces beneath hoods in town lately. It's around the taverns that you come across them most often. One of the locals said he saw them pick up a drunken sailor and carry him off somewhere, and no one's seen the sailor since. Recently a few fine soldiers went missing from my barracks as well - they've certainly never turned down a drink. My subordinates are all good lads, but if I put them on the case, they'll only make a load of noise. So I ask you, Knight of the Academy, to help me, in whatever way you can, to resolve this situation.

﻿quest_system_1671787950_desc	As I’ve said before, your services to the Order and the Kingdom are worthy of the greatest of rewards! I can only assure you that from now on I will watch your destiny closely. I think that, with time, you will understand how valuable this is. Commander Tarcus, meanwhile, will provide you more tangible reward. He loves to do that. He’s waiting for you now!
quest_system_1671787950_done	Ah, the Archmage has finally released you! I tremble to think what might have happened had you not arrived at our island in the nick of time! Therefore... in the name of the King, I pronounce you Knight of the Kingdom of the Three Islands, and bestow upon you all of the associated rights and responsibilities! Please accept this modest reward... It is genuinely modest in comparison with that which awaits you. The King has expressed his wish to meet you personally! Perhaps you will be granted the honor of membership in the Royal Legion. An elite league of generals, protecting our land from all of its dangerous enemies. But the storm season is upon us, and you cannot yet make the journey to Karakol. However, I think you’ll have enough to do here. After Lazarus’ defeat, his remaining gangs and mobs of barbarians have settled all over the island. We must finish what we have started, and uproot our enemies! As soon as the possibility arises, I will arrange you an audience with the king... Our meeting is now finished. I hope that we shall meet again soon!

﻿quest_system_1688321569_desc	I am aware that you are in a hurry to visit the sanctuary of the Order of the Mages. However, the key that you've got only removes the astral seals; it does not disarm any magic traps. One must train certain qualities within oneself to overcome those. Magic is a temptation, you know, and it can drive one insane. You need an inner equilibrium in order to resist temptation. Therefore, we have to focus on your concentration first and foremost. Bring me a few Royal Thorn seeds. This might seem a strange task to you, but you will discover that this quest will help you acquire the qualities you need – patience and endurance
quest_system_1688321569_done	I see that you've proved your endurance adequate to this task, as simple as it is complex. Let us now proceed to our next challenge, so that you may learn some new lessons.

But there is one problem. As you may recall, I don’t have any helpers, and as a result, I don’t have any ingredients either. So any help is welcome. I need Griffin Feathers. You will need to pick a fight with these birds of prey. They are actually quite dangerous. Legendary creatures! This means that you need to be well prepared before fighting them: buy a few magic scrolls, and recruit a few trustworthy warriors. Ready?

I think it’s a great assignment; trust me, it’s much better than being stuck in this hole and breathing in the dust of the march. But I digress... Tarcus mentioned some Priest of Rusith here in the Eastern Fort whom you should meet. I don’t get involved in this kind of stuff, but it seems very important.

Same as usual. Who comes into this neck of the woods? Just beasts around here. It’s clear all the way to Bear Forest. Go there and find Tender, the forest ranger, at the crossroads. He knows all there is to know about that area.

﻿quest_system_1759881886_desc	Yes, I’ve heard of Lazarus. Where from? Well... you know, prisoners will talk if you’re, uh, persuasive enough. It seems that Lazarus leads all of these troublemakers. But I don’t think he’s the real leader. Speak with our priest, Saphaor. He’s been researching this Apostate, as he calls him. I’m sure he’ll send you in the right direction.
quest_system_1759881886_done	Well, does Taron finally understand the hot water we’re in? Probably not; just scared witless. But the gods will judge him when the time comes. Would you like to know about Lazarus? Great. I’ll tell you about him. Lazarus is the leader of the cult which calls themselves the Speakers with the Dead. They don’t have any ties to real Speakers. They’re just a handful of Transformed Ones who think that they’ve mastered the rituals and magic of the ancient Guardians. You’ve never encountered any of the Transformed? Strange... However, they’re not allowed in the Kingdom of the Three Islands; their land is on the old Elven Ridge. The Transformed Ones are products of the Cataclysm which happened at the beginning of the War. Flows of magical energy distorted many living creatures, giving them surprising, and sometimes abominable, new characteristics and abilities. Werewolves and vampires and such are all Transformed Ones. But their danger doesn’t lie in their differences in appearance. The dangerous ones are those who were born with magical abilities. Sometimes these abilities don’t even need to be developed. The Transformed Necromancers are such creatures. If they choose, they can pass for normal mortals. They’re the backbone of the sect of Lazarus. What do they need here? I don’t know. They captured an ancient heathen temple north of here. It seems that something was moved there. Perhaps the hallows of one of the Guardians, or even some relics. Why was it moved? I don’t know, but... What?! Manuscripts describing a ritual to awaken the ancient powers have been stolen?! Hmm. Looks like this is a very serious matter.

﻿quest_system_1977238436_desc	Your Archmage spared no effort. If it hadn't been for his support... Oh, you haven't noticed anything, have you? Seven of the Order’s strongest mages formed a circle, forming a rapport of the sort used by the Transformed Ones. However, theirs was several times stronger. They kept the forces of Lazarus bound during the final battle. You don't think that our victory over these madmen is just your doing, do you? They also helped me with making a breach in the dome. I shouldn't have thought so poorly of Albus... Go to him now – he is waiting for you in the Northern Bay.
quest_system_1977238436_done	Here comes our hero! You played an immense role in the victory over Lazarus, make no mistake. As soon as I received the deciphered excerpt from the ancient manuscripts sent by the Abbot, I realized how close we were to catastrophe. The Keepers warned that any attempt to resurrect the remains would lead to an enormous outburst of magical energy rather than the resurrection of their owner. Apparently, Lazarus brought over some of the remains that once had belonged to one of the Lords – the demiurges from the dawn of time responsible for the creation of all these worlds. Lazarus found the Heathen Fane, where it would have been easy for him to set that whole mechanism into motion. He intended to make his exit right before the explosion. Were he to succeed, the Archipelago and the Kingdom of the Three Isles would have been wiped out of existence by now... The role of the Free Jarls is of particular interest. Previously they've been known to us only as your run-of-the-mill sedentary pirates of the north, but now... Now they have challenged us. By the way, an explosion at the Heathen Fane would have damaged their islands as well. I wonder if they knew anything of it, or whether the Transformed Ones decided to leave them in the dark. There's some food for thought now.

﻿quest_system_1982299792_desc	Triumphing over a few vagabonds is not yet a good enough reason to be bragging about your talents as a commander. Try using some tactical skills this time around. We have been trying to catch a troop of Archer Deserters. Their arrows are capable of reaching opponents across an impressive distance, so getting to them is not as simple. Warriors inflict additional damage to Archers. When putting your army together, make sure to include a large number of fast, close-range warriors.
quest_system_1982299792_done	By cleverly picking out whom to include in your army, you will gain a significant advantage. Remember what you learned in the Knight’s Academy. Protect your warriors in battle, and you will not need to spend more gold to replenish your ranks.

﻿quest_system_1992564190_desc	The inhabitants of the local villages are complaining more and more about the walking dead in the swamps west of here. I’m concerned for the future of our settlement - if a couple of these Zombies reach the city, a real epidemic may start. But if you destroy some of them, it will substantially reduce the risk of infection. I think that’s a great idea! I’ll reward you well for your help.
quest_system_1992564190_done	You have completed a job of great importance. As long as the zombies are not too many, the fort guards will be able to push them back into the swamp. And nothing will threaten the health of our citizens.

﻿quest_system_2019863595_desc	Don't get me wrong, your grace. I'm not asking for money. I am going to pay myself. We have a heck of a problem here. Look around you and behold – all the fields come to ear, grain ripens aplenty. But there is not going to be a harvest, no siree! Why? Because of the Unicorns, that's why! My neighbor's field got stomped through, and the village elder's corn got half-munched. Could you, maybe, quiet them down a bit? I'll be glad to compensate you for your efforts. Otherwise, they'll get to my fields soon enough.

Fancy trying to revive ancient powers and hoping to control them! The Guardians tried it once, and their attempt brought about the Cataclysm. On the other hand... Perhaps he didn't mean to control them after all? Could he have wanted for the catastrophe that afflicted a faraway continent once to repeat and hit inhabited islands this time. Would he have perished himself? Hardly. Nothing would hold him from opening a portal and winding up halfway across the globe. He would dump his soldiers here, though – they are mere tools to him.

Please do me a favor and destroy at least some of them before the Archmage hears about it.
quest_system_2045221165_done	Thank you for your help. I have to reconsider the formula, no doubt about it. Either too much mandrake, or I should have used an extraction essence instead of an essence.

﻿quest_system_2068579035_desc	Prepare your men to head out. I have just received a message from the Library Ruins. Someone is trying to steal the ancient manuscripts from the basements of the library. Naturally, there were marauders that had tried to steal things before, but this time it looks more serious. Go to Charon the Archivist, and do what’s needed. Just be careful. It is quite easy to get ambushed in the ruins.
quest_system_2068579035_done	By Rusith, they finally sent me some help. The people in Kronberg think we just fool around in here! Even the guard station was transferred to the North Bay.

﻿quest_system_2108461649_desc	Oh yes. You were saying that you needed some kind of help. Let's see . . . ah, so these manuscripts have a very basic alchemic seal upon them. I can remove it using an alkaline mithril solution mixed with poisonous thorn-juice. Give me your manuscripts. I see. What? These ghosts came right out of the manuscripts. No, that can’t be. A double seal! By removing one, we release the guardian ghosts from the other one. I beg of you. Do something! I won’t survive having my laboratory trashed again!<br>
quest_system_2108461649_done	That’s it? I was sure that the ghosts would finish your troops off and then move on to me. But I can see that you aren’t so easily scared.

﻿quest_system_2110497605_desc	A repelling spell has been cast on the port and the town has gone mad for a couple of days. Good thing my boys are always alert. They told me that a small boat has arrived to one of the wharfs that is hidden from sight because it is located a bit farther away from town. In the boat there were several tall masked men equipped with strange devices apparently made of tubes and vials. They used potions of some sort to put the guards to sleep and stole the keys to the royal arsenal, which is where all the explosive reagents are kept. If these tinkerers lay their hands on them, they’ll be able to blow up half the town. They need to be stopped as quickly as possible.
quest_system_2110497605_done	Thank Rusith! The soldiers are alive! Meanwhile, I found out more about those people. They were a troop of well-trained alchemists and inventors, Chaos-worshippers all. They have the knowledge to produce potions that neutralize the effects of other spells. It was a pre-planned attack, just as I feared. No one but them could have gotten into the Port through the magic barrier. Thank you for your help and for saving all of our lives.

The humble prayers of generations of hermit priests have given the artifact its special power. Because of this, it was the final item used to seal the gates of the Tiltyard archives. They then entrusted the amulet to the Hermit of Shady Grove for safekeeping. Get the amulet from him. Now, the hermit is kinda weird, but I hope you'll be able to talk some sense into him.
