chat_system_1409183322_snap_11_question	I look to you to find a swift resolution to this problem. This is a matter of state security: the Archmage is the governor of the Order of Mages in our town. There's no time to waste, so I suggest you hurry. In the meantime, I'll deal with the attack on the Royal Library.

chat_system_1409183322_snap_2_question	Well, have you sent all those cadavers back to their graves yet, or are there still some left? The reason there are so many corpses is that a long time ago a war was fought not far from the town. During the war, several enormous Royal frigates were sunk along with their crew. Poor souls.
