quest_system_1158555043_desc	The Crystal of Arymbus conceals something vital. Captain Alistair is already in hot pursuit of these cultists. Get in touch with him at once – he's at the Gray Warden Garrison to the West. We might be able to apprehend the cultists and retrieve the ancient artifact before they find a use for it. Hmmm... What could possibly be hidden inside this ancient crystal? I shall call for a session of the Magister Council post haste.
