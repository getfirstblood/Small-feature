quest_system_685901611_desc	The main power of the Temple Defenders isn’t the blades of the pirates or barbarians, but the Lazarus cultists. Their magic is protecting the entrances. So, if you want to weaken the defences, you must weaken the cultists. Or just kill them. Destroy the Demonologists. Then you can enter the temple unnoticed.
