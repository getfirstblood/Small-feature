quest_system_427984666_desc	Looks like your army suffered a loss in its last battle! Don’t worry about the lives of your warriors. Soldiers who fall in battle do not die; they are taken to the Infirmary and wait for you to restore them to life. To resurrect the fallen, you need to spend a part of your stamina and some gold. The Infirmary is in the Army Management window.
