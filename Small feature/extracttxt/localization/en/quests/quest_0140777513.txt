quest_system_140777513_desc	The spiders have been coming out of the forest for the second day in a row. Their lair is there, but never before have they left it. At least not in these numbers. I have a hunch that something has incited them to flood in like this. When the troops come, they’ll have to fight their way through, and inevitably they’ll suffer some losses. I have some spider venom antidote, but not enough for such a large party. But for you and your warriors I’ll get a few flasks from my old supply. Destroy some Fiery Spiders and some Cave Spiders. It may scare the rest away.
quest_system_140777513_done	Well, now there are less of them around. Don’t know for how long, though. We must figure out what incited them to action.
