quest_system_1949729563_desc	Many have I helped, many have I saved from disease and afflictions, but I cannot save myself... An old witch keeps all human woes inside until she goes mad, and I am nearly there. Ooh... All kinds of visions are overcoming me – there are monsters man has never seen, then there are ghosts ghosts, and vampires. Wait and see them bringing me to my grave. I cannot go to the coven like this. Would you mind helping me? I will give you an enchanted stone, so you can see my nightmares and chase them out of my head if you can.
