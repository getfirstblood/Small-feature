quest_system_1630508978_desc	I see a key in your hands. Apparently, I must let you pass; pray do. But know that the sanctuary is filled with the minions of the mage that came here before you. Could it be that I stand between you and a great deal of trouble? They will attack you as soon as I open the passage. Be prepared.
