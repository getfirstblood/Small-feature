quest_system_1263770283_desc	Your Archmage is good. Good thing we had his support. Ah, I forgot, you didn’t notice anything. Seven of the Order’s strongest mages formed a circle, using the same sort of connection used by the Transformed Ones. Only their connection was many times stronger. They shackled the forces of Lazarus during the struggle. You didn’t think that our victory rested purely on your services? They helped me destroy the dome, too. I shouldn’t have thought poorly of Survus... Now go to him, to Kronberg. He awaits your arrival!
quest_system_1263770283_done	Don’t bow. You’re an equal among equals here. That’s right. Your part in Lazarus’ defeat was no lesser than mine. As soon as I received the deciphered tablet from the Abbot, I realized that we were on the brink of a catastrophe. The Guardians warned that the animation of relics, if the ritual were performed with any mistakes, would lead not to a resurrection of the Master, but to an immense explosion of magical energy. It seems that Lazarus brought from the Master’s Homeland some of the relics of one of the Lords. One of the ancestral creators that formed these worlds. Lazarus found this temple, a place where he could easily begin the ritual. He planned to escape before the explosion. I’m afraid that nothing would have remained of the Archipelago and the Kingdom of the Three Islands. The Free Jarls are playing an interesting role. Until now we knew them only as normal, settled pirates from the North, but now... now they have decided to issue us a challenge. By the way, the explosion at the temple would have hit their island. Did they know about this? Or had the Transformed Ones planned to take them out quietly? I wonder...
