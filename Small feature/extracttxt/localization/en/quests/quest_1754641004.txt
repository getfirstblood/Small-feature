But, knowing that you have influence both on the Commander and the Archmage, I am trying to dissuade you, to convince you that my plan is effective. You have a strong party. Please head out and defeat a few gangs that seem suspicious. I’m sure that, afterwards, you will agree that they’re nothing more than rabble!

Please forgive me, I’m just too upset... it’s hard to take in such news so quickly. But Signal Island! By St. Rusith, I must warn them!
