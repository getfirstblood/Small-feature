quest_system_735041194_desc	Honestly, this forest is just nice and dandy. Except for the Unicorns that stomp around all night long, keeping everybody from sleeping. And nothing is as important as a good night’s sleep; in sleep men undergo a transformation and cleanse that... what’s it called? Anyway, you don’t even have to wash – that’s what my neighborhood healer says. And cleanliness for me is the greatest of all virtues. So, there’s no doubt what we must do. Get those unicorns out of here!
