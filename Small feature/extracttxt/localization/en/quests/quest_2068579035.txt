quest_system_2068579035_desc	Prepare your men to head out. I have just received a message from the Library Ruins. Someone is trying to steal the ancient manuscripts from the basements of the library. Naturally, there were marauders that had tried to steal things before, but this time it looks more serious. Go to Charon the Archivist, and do what’s needed. Just be careful. It is quite easy to get ambushed in the ruins.

But, our mission here is of great importance. Some of the oldest books and manuscripts, each of unimaginable value, are stored here.
