quest_system_192860474_desc	The good thing about Ents: They have acorns. Acorns are important. Well, one could manage without acorns, I guess; it may be just a matter of taste. I personally prefer my brews with acorns. You agree? Well, it’s not like you have to. Your task is Ents! Let’s say, ten of them! Or more, if you can manage.
quest_system_192860474_done	Nicely done. Now I can get as many acorns as I please. What are the acorns for? Well, for my brews. With acorns in it, the brew is better, stronger. It makes your mood merrier.
