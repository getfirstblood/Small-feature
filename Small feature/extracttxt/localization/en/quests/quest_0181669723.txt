quest_system_181669723_desc	I’ll be frank; this is no place for the army to walk around peacefully. There’s a bandit or a thug waiting around every corner. And now the Scarlet Sash Pirates from the North are adding to our misery. They used to come only at night, but now they invade in broad daylight. But their gangs are not very large, so you’ll manage. Otherwise the Commander will have both our heads for failing to assure safe passage for the guardsmen along this road.
quest_system_181669723_done	What? Just a few weaklings? Well, maybe now there are just a few of them, but when it gets dark, there’s a whole bunch. So you did a good deed, both to help the troops and to protect us.
