quest_system_692352185_desc	This is my friend. He is a tree. I mean, a real tree. We have a friendly chat in the evening, and in the morning I weed the grass around him. But lately our lands were invaded by griffins. They like to tear off tree bark and break tree branches. I won’t let my friend be treated like that. Maybe you could deal with these beasts nicely . . . Or not so nicely.
