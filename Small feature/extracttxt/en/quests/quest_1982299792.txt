quest_system_1982299792_desc	Triumphing over a few vagabonds is not yet a good enough reason to be bragging about your talents as a commander. Try using some tactical skills this time around. We have been trying to catch a troop of Archer Deserters. Their arrows are capable of reaching opponents across an impressive distance, so getting to them is not as simple. Warriors inflict additional damage to Archers. When putting your army together, make sure to include a large number of fast, close-range warriors.
