quest_system_786897707_desc	I have just received news of what our mages were able to find out. The necromancers' manuscripts have been enchanted with a special alchemical seal. One of its components is the poison of a thousand year old spider, among other strange things. To be honest, I'm not very good at alchemy, but I think that the inhabitants of the Engineers' Reservation will be able to help. Go to Meshmer the Engineer. He's just the man we need.
