quest_system_1586935370_desc	Fierce battles were fought here in the olden days. Sorcerers and warriors fought the spawn of the underworld, protecting our lands from their attacks. Many of them are buried in this land, but someone has chosen to meddle with them, even after death. These heinous Flesh Conjurors are always coming here to revive the long-dead warriors. Such a disgrace of history is unacceptable and should be terminated immediately.
