quest_system_1027869987_desc	This is my first encounter with a problem of this kind. On the one hand, the shoreline spell is simple, a mirror-type spell. But on the other hand, I can’t detect the flow of binding energies, which I must do in order to start detangling the chain of thought-forms. I made a couple of estimates, but even an archdemon himself could get lost in this mess. I need help... Yes, yes, I do! But I can’t ask these bumpkins for help. I can trust you, since you are the Commander’s authorized agent. Please deliver these calculations to the Archmage, my former teacher. I’m sure he’ll be able to figure out what’s wrong.
quest_system_1027869987_done	What is this, some kind of a conspiracy? First, Charon goes all weird on me, and then Locrim, my former student... What thought-forms is he talking about? His own calculations show that this is a simple spell, and of a lower category, too... Admittedly, its power indicates that a sacrifice was made...
