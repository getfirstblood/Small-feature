quest_system_501156598_desc	This key may seem to be wrought less finely than the previous one, but rest assured that it will be just as functional. To tell you the truth, I thought I'd forgotten how to marry the hammer and the anvil, but the hands remember it all. How did I manage to live without my craft for so long? Let me thank you once again for everything that you've done for me. I hope my help will be of use to you as well. Give my regards to Albus the Archmage. Perhaps the Order of the Mages will commission me for something someday.
