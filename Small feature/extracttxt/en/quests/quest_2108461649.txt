I can remove it using an alkaline mithril solution mixed with poisonous thorn-juice. Give me your manuscripts. I see. What? These ghosts came right out of the manuscripts. No, that can’t be. A double seal! By removing one, we release the guardian ghosts from the other one. I beg of you. Do something! I won’t survive having my laboratory trashed again!<br>

You know that ghosts are extremely attracted to life-giving potions. They are convinced that those potions can help them to be reborn. A very naive point of view if you ask me.<br>
