quest_system_634083688_desc	There were three mages on our island who studied forbidden magic. Monsters that they summoned with their sorcery held entire towns in terror. When a hunt for the three began, they managed to go into hiding. We pursued them and tracked them down by traces of their magical aura. Our search has taken us to this island. The mages have established three separate settlements and are apparently gaining strength. I will show where they can be found, and your job will be to defeat their armies until it's too late.
