quest_system_989012017_desc	Legionary, I congratulate you on your first victories! They have brought you not only valuable combat experience but also credibility. So now you can lead a large army into battle. Which means it's time to fill your ranks with new recruits. Each village has recruits who want to fight under the banner of a famous general. Try to recruit a few Archers in the nearest shop.
