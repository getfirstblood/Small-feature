quest_system_540339822_desc	All right. I understand that you need these scouts for a very important mission. But who gave them the right to make so much noise out here? They started scouting through the forests, and scared off all the animals. The hunting season has been ruined, and someone must compensate for our losses. If you collect enough hides and furs for us, then I will pardon these disturbers of the peace.
